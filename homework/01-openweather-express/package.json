Write an endpoint called `temperatureHamburg` that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch the information about Hamburg and provide only the current temperature as a plain number (the `Content-Type` of your response should be `application/json`). 3. Write an endpoint called `hottestCity` that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch the data from five cities of your choice (e.g. Alexandria, Buenos Aires, Chicago, Dublin, Essen) and return the _name_ of the city where it currently \"Feels Like\" the hottest.",
