# Exercise 1: Openweather API with Express

1. Create a new node.js app called openweather-express (and set it up accordingly).
2. Write an endpoint called `temperatureHamburg` that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch the information about Hamburg and provide only the current temperature as a plain number (the `Content-Type` of your response should be `application/json`).
3. Write an endpoint called `hottestCity` that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch the data from five cities of your choice (e.g. Alexandria, Buenos Aires, Chicago, Dublin, Essen) and return the _name_ of the city where it currently "Feels Like" the hottest.

Note: Step 3 is much more difficult than step 2, but don't let that discourage you. That is intentional, I don't expect you to finish everything. Start with one thing, then try to solve the next, step by step.
